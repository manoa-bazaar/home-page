# Manoalist
This project is to build an an application for UHM students to facilitate buying and selling of student-related goods and service. Our goal is to work as a team and develop a nice website call "Manoalist".

Manoalist allows user to:

- Register a account
- Login to view the items for sell
- Post for sell item information
- Rate seller after purchase

## User Interface Walkthrough

### Landing page

When you first bring up the application, you will see the landing page that provides a brief introduction to manoalist. So sellers and buyers can read to know how this application works.

We can build something like this and we can make the UI looks nicer.

## Expectation
The website will provide a secure and fair platform for UH Manoa students to post their product informations. Users can post valid information about their products on the platform, and the products will be displayed by searching their key words(label). It will be similar to the existing website "Craigslist".
