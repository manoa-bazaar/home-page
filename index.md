# Manoalist
This project is to build an an application for UHM students to facilitate buying and selling of student-related goods and service. Our goal is to work as a team and develop a nice website call "Manoalist".

Manoalist allows user to:

- Register a account
- Login to view the items for sell
- Post for sell item information
- Rate seller after purchase

## User Interface Walkthrough

When you first bring up the application, you will see the landing page that provides a brief introduction to manoalist. So sellers and buyers can read to know how this application works.
